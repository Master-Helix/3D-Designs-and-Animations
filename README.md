# 3D-Designs-and-Animations

 ------------    Hi, This is RAKSHIT PANDEY aka MASTER HELIX   --------------

--> I have created these 3D designs and Animations using the open source software - BLENDER 3D.<br>
--> You can use or have a look to my Designs and Animations from this repository and can use as an asset if required.<br>
--> These files are .blend files and will open only in a 3D modelling software (preferred - Blender 3D).<br>
--> to see the output design, run these files on the software and click on render Images/ Animation to see the Output.<br>
--> For Designs, preview the Render using CYCLES Option.<br>
--> For Animations, preview the Render using EEVEE Option.<br><br>

--> Do give a Star to the Repo, if you liked my Designs.<br>

----------------------THANK YOU---------------------------------------------------------
